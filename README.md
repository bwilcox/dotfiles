## Bill's Dotfiles

This is a small repo which contain basic configurations for things
I usually like to have in my Unixy systems.  It sets up my shell
the way I like it and includes the vim extensions I like to have.

The gitignore is important as I'm ignoring everything execpt the 
dotfiles necessary for setting up my terminal preferences.
